# React Blog App

## [Live demo](https://se19-mern-blog.herokuapp.com/)

This is a blog app with basic JWT authentication, implemented using the **MERN** stack.
My first time ever writing a react application :monkey:

## Note

The deployment link will seem to freeze the first time you visit it, that's because heroku sleeps the inactive `dynos`, both the application and the API server as well, and I didn't bother putting in any spinners to indicate loading :grin:
